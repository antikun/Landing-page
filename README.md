Landing page project. Final assignment for the HTML/CSS section in The Odin Project Foundations course.

Had a lot of fun doing this project. Decided to go a bit beyond what was originally required for the project, so I had to look up some stuff on how to make the web page responsive, for example. It took quite a lot of experimentation to get to the current point where I'm mostly satisfied whith how it turned out. It's not great by any means, and there's a lot to improve on, for sure.

Often times I was frustrated with the styling, and most of it was related to the usual suspects (for me at least) - flexbox, margin, padding... Even though I feel I understand these concepts very well *in theory*, I find it that when I actually try to apply this knowledge I'm often doing a lot of guess work. Probably means that I *don't* actually understand how things in CSS work, but hey, I'm just going to have to practice more and give my best to make it click for me at some point.

Anyway, hope you enjoy the page I created.

Below I list links to the images I used for the page layout.
